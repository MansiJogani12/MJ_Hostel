  <h2>About MJ Hostel</h2>

    <p>
      The <span class="highlight">Hostel Management System</span> is a user-friendly web application designed to help students manage their hostel-related tasks and information efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Features include student registration, profile management, complaints, fee tracking, food menu viewing, and access to hostel rules and regulations—all in one responsive and intuitive dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This system is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with <span class="highlight">localStorage</span> used to store and retrieve student data securely on the client side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aim of this system is to simplify communication between hostel administration and students while maintaining transparency and accessibility.
